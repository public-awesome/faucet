The `FAUCET_CHANNEL_INTERVAL` variable is a comma-separated list of channel names and the interval of time to wait before allowing another request by the same user or recipient address. If no interval is provided for a channel the default of 1 hour will be used.

The `FAUCET_CLIENT_CHAIN_ID` variable is the id of the chain the faucet is running on.

The `FAUCET_CLIENT_GAS_PRICES` variable is the gas price to use for the faucet transactions.

The `FAUCET_CLIENT_RPC_URL` variable is the url of the rpc endpoint of the chain the faucet is running on.

The `FAUCET_CLIENT_API_ENDPOINT` variable is the url of the rest/api endpoint of the chain the faucet is running on.
